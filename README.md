# openai-telegram-bot
Granted access to OpenAI's API Beta and decided to connect it to Telegram via a Telegram Bot.

Telegram Users can take advantage of two features by typing in a group chat with an invited Bot,

Either auto-completion via typing /ac in chat, or have their questions answered via /qa.

Uses Flask and Webhooks, as well as ngrok to tunnel for localhost deployment - soon to be moved to Heroku.

Requires a Telegram Bot Key, OpenAI API Key, and potentially setting up ngrok if you want to run this locally.
